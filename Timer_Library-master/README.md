# Timer_Library
Timer library for C++ 

I build this library out of personal need that then turned into a small side project to learn more C++

###Features
 * _**Count Down Timer**_
   * Sleep till the 24-hour time pass in
   * ap_timer(22,15,0) 
      * will sleep till 10:15PM
 * _**Threadable Timer**_
   * Same functionality as ap_timer but is threadable (Pthreads)


###Future Work
 * None, made just for learning purposes
